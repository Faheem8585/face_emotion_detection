# Keep the best model for the user to run the app, but usually we gitignore models. 
# Since the user wants to push to github, maybe they want the model? 
# Standard practice is NOT to push large models. 
# But for this specific request "clean directory that I can push", I'll leave the model 
# unless it's too large (>100MB). The model is ~45MB so it fits in GitHub.
